<h3>Table with 4 cities using markdown</h3> 

<p>I will prefer my friends to visit 4 temples in four different cities in India which follows.

I used bars (pipes) to separate cities,location,Time.Used dashes to separate headers from data.then used to show alignment on dashes (:left/:center:/right:).

Can add spaces to help readability

<table border="1px solid black";border-collapse="collapse">
