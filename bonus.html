    <h4>the mascot of College of Mount Saint Vincent</h4>
    <p>
        Since mythical times, the Dolphin has been considered the most intelligent of water-dwelling animals because of their ability to communicate via a language. Contrary to popular belief, the nickname, "Dolphins" was not selected because of the proximity of the Mount Saint Vincent campus to the Hudson River.
    </p>
    <li>Those elected to The Dolphins received such an honor because of demonstrated character, loyalty, cooperation, and participation in school activities.</li>
    <li>Mount Saint Vincent is one of only five NCAA member institutions that utilize the Dolphin mascot. </li>
   <li>The selection of the new Brand was the latest step in the evolution of the Mount Saint Vincent Dolphin.</li>
