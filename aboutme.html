     <h3>Sita Ramam</h3>
     <p>
        “Why did she fall in love with a normal soldier? Because he is.. Ram #SitaRamam was adorable and so was Ram's characterisation. Top Notch work by Dulquer so much that this film wouldn't have been this effective with another actor. The last few minutes of the film is so good!” wrote one user. While another wrote, “Such a beautiful film #SitaRamam is. I loved the lead characters. Ram was truly a character that you can get inspired from!! @dulQuer"
